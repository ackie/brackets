	Renamed less.js to more.js (including all references to LESS within)
	Renamed CodeMirror's less.js to more.js (including all references to LESS within)
	Added this extension, just requiring the CodeMirror mode
	Result: Called EditorUtils.js _getModeFromFileExtensions with an unhandled file extension: more (EditorUtils.js:163)
[ ] Add easy way to map an extension to a CodeMirror mode - or use the file extension string as the mode (probably dangerous)
	Monkey-patched getModeFromFileExtensions to use file extension as mode name if such a mode exists
[ ] Load (language) extensions earlier to support their CodeMirror modes for the file automatically opened at startup (last open file)
	Added a function that changes the mode of current editors if (after adding the new mode) a different one would be used when re-opening the editor
	Looked for what else we support about LESS, so far found line and block comments via EditorCommandHandlers.js
[ ] Allow extensions to define how to add comments for a specific CodeMirror mode
    Monkey patching not easily possible to references to internal functions
	Difficulty when making comments more generic is that we rely on the defined comment symbols to be completely contained in one CodeMirror token.
	I.e. we cannot define "//~" as the prefix for line comments (like SciTE does) because it is not a prefix of the "//" token.
